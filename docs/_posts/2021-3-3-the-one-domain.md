These days, it is very likely that all popular domain endings (co, com, org, io ...) for your first name are probably gone if you have a popular name like me ðŸ˜‚. If so, you should buy yourname.one, and this article tells you why.

## My Situation

When I decided to start my website, I was quite stuck on what domain I should buy ![](https://blog.siddharth.one/the-one-tld/photo.jpeg) Here is a list of all TLDs available under Â£10/year. As you can see, all good domains are gone, only some left. I was left thinking what I should do?

## My Reasoning

I had to rule out com.au and fr because they were related to countries.

*   it: Can mean IT or Italian, but does not fit
*   business: too long
*   icu: Not quite right
*   contact: too long
*   fans: Doesn't quite work here
*   pictures: I am not a photographer...yet. The only option's I was left with were .page and .one.

Page really sounded like a good deal, but I realised that it had one extra letter, and this was a deciding factor. There were also several reasons why I liked one.

## Reasons I like .one

*   The one and only me.
*   Sounds catchy
*   Short and same amount of letters as com
*   Not related to any country
*   No single purpose

So in the end I bought one domain with no regrets
