**Update: Since then I have rebuilt my website from ground up. However, I still stand by the fact that Tailblocks is a great resource.**

I recently discovered this tool that allowed me to rapidly build my website. Hope it might be useful.

## What is Tailwindcss
[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) is a utility based css framework for rapid development and is very useful in some cases. My own [website](https://siddharth.one) is built entirely on tailwindcss, so I definitely would recommend it to you.

## Tailblocks
[Tailblocks](https://mertjf.github.io/tailblocks/) is a very simple tool that provides you with readymade Tailwindcss blocks. It includes most of the blocks that you would need to build a great website, including navbars, hero sections and footers.

## How to use
1. Setup your html document like below



```html
<iDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta name="viewport"  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Your title</title>
<link href="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

2. Go to [tailblocks](https://mertjf.github.io/tailblocks/)

3. Pick out a block you like.
   ![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/qczillga8zemwyvot7zm.png)

4. Click the '<>View Code' button.

5. Copy the code.

6. Paste it into the html document and voila ü§Ø

7. Repeat the process with as many blocks as you like üëç.
